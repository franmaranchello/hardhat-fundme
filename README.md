# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a Hardhat environment. It comes with a crowdfunding contract, a set of unit and integration tests for that contract, and a set of scripts and configurations to deploy that contract to different EVM-compatible blockchain networks (local, testnets, or mainnets).

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
yarn hardhat help
yarn test
yarn hardhat node
yarn hardhat deploy
yarn hardhat deploy --network hardhat (localhost deploy)
yarn hardhat deploy --network goerli (testnet or mainnet deploy)
```

Look at `package.json` for more custom commands.
